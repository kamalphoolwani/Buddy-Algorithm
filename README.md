# Buddy Algorithm

## Description

   The objective of project is to implement a malloc library, which includes `malloc`,
   `free`, `realloc`, `calloc`,`reallocarray`, `memalign`, `posix_memalign` and other dynamic memory allocation
   routines. In this particular implementation, it is required to use Buddy
   Algorithm for memory allocation. In addtion, the returned address from this
   library should be aligned at 8-byte boundary, and the library should be thread-safe.

## Installation requirement

`g++ compiler`

## How To Run
Run the following commands in same folder in which Makefile is present.
 *  `make`

 *  `./ibfs`

 ## Functions
 Following functions implemented with name
 ```
 * malloc : my_malloc
 * calloc : my_calloc
 * realloc : my_realloc
 * reallocarray : my_reallocarray
 * memalign : my_memalign
 * posix_memalign : my_posix_memalign
 * free : my_free
```
